# TITLE: TEST AUDTOMATION USING CANoe/CAPL FOR BATTERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The main idea of this project is to automate the testing of BMS using CANoe and CAPL scripting. Automation will help in ease the testing process whenever there is upgradation new feature in the BMS. With CANoe, a test report will be generated. This report will consist of voltage pattern  at different scenarios and features of the BMS will be noted down with test case status.

# RESEARCH
OBJECTIVES:
-	Understanding CANoe and CAPL Scripting
-	Understanding Test Automation
- To get a clear idea about Battery Management System
- To Learn how to write Test cases and Generate Test Report
